# ‚úàÔ∏è Global Flight Route Network Analysis

##  Overview

This project explores worldwide airline route data with a focused analysis on **Edinburgh Airport (EDI)**.
Using both **Python** and **Tableau**, the goal is to understand:

- Where passengers fly from Edinburgh
- Which airlines dominate this market
- Which airports are underserved
<-- How route networks compare between Edinburgh and other major hubs like **London** -->

The insights are presented using **interactive Tableau dashboards** and **Python-based data analysis** with visualizations.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Visualize global routes from Edinburgh Airport
- Identify:
  - ‚úÖ Top and bottom destination cities
  - ‚úàÔ∏è Most active airlines from Edinburgh
  - üö´ Underserved airports (with only outgoing routes)
  - ‚öñÔ∏è Airports with imbalanced incoming/outgoing traffic
- Compare flight networks between **Edinburgh** and **London**

---

## üìä Tableau Dashboard

Built in [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/), the interactive dashboard includes:

- üåç **World map of routes** from Edinburgh
- üîù **Top 10 destinations**
- ‚õî **Least served cities**
- üè¢ **Airlines with the most destinations**
- üìå **Destination countries**
- üîÑ Optional comparison with **London**

## üêç Python Analysis

### üìÅ Data Sources:
- `airports.dat` ‚Äî Airport codes, locations, names
- `airlines.dat` ‚Äî Airline names and status
- `routes.dat` ‚Äî Raw route data between airports

### üîß Processing Steps:
- Clean and merge datasets
- Create `routes_clean.csv`
- Analyze total traffic per airport
- Detect airports with:
  - No incoming flights
  - Heavy traffic imbalance
- Save processed files as CSV and generate charts

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3** (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- **Tableau Public**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **CSV Data (OpenFlights.org)**

---

## üí° Key Insights

- Low-cost carriers like **EasyJet** and **Ryanair** dominate Edinburgh's market
- Top destinations include **London**, **Paris**, and **Amsterdam**
- Some airports have **no return flights**, which may suggest:
  - Seasonal routes
  - Strategic flight planning gaps
- Route networks can differ significantly between **Edinburgh** and **London**

---

## üìå Future Work

- Add **temporal data** (flight frequency, seasonality)
- Calculate **route distances** or durations
- Include **passenger volume or aircraft type**
- Build **country-to-country connection map**
